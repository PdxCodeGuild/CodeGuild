# Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer n. Assuming that this integer is in seconds, your program should convert the number of seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds and prints them exactly in the format specified below. Here are a few sample runs of what your program is supposed to do:

# 369121517 = 4272 days 5 hours 45 minutes 17 seconds

# def time(days)

n = int(input("How many seconds would you like calculated to time?: "))
